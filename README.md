# Uplexa-wallet-cli.py-set-up-for-wallet-balance-and-transactions-


how this was set up is through the CLI of uplexa and with it was the ability to look at balance transaction and selling and sending ability of wallet account with that you will have to run the uplexa main file from gitHub for their respiratories or directories for their files and in that file include the CLI with your own iP address for local hosting and with that you should gain access with your seed phrase to see your balance how many tokens you mind and what not and the selling and buying ability of a token or trading ability if you set it up that way this is all done through terminal and can be ran on Android when your node for your wallet is down so you can always see your balance and always use a cryptocurrency please do not use my IP address that is linked in this file it was done to make sure that it could work properly the only thing I have not tested out a seed phrase but everything else is operating properly if not I will be fixing the file in a couple days from now as time goes on
